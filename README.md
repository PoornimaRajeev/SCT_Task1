## 📌 Task Objective

Create clear and informative bar charts or histograms to visualize the distribution of a key variable in the dataset.

---

## 🎯 What I Did

- Selected an important feature from the dataset (`heart.csv`) for analysis.
- Created histograms and bar charts using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.
- Focused on making plots visually appealing and easy to interpret.
- Carried out **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to understand distribution patterns.
